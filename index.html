        <h3>Introduction to Test Driven Development The Pillar Way</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Pillar is an IT and business consulting company dedicated to solving
        our clients' most challenging problems through both valuable and
        cleanly written code. We hold eXtreme programming practices and
        Software Craftsmanship in the highest regard. We work in a
        collaborative Pair Programming environment with a heavy focus on Test
        Driven Development (TDD) to continuously deliver value to clients in
        all languages and environments. We're a close knit,
        intellectually-charged team and we are very excited by the prospect of
        you coming aboard!<br><br>Candidates are
        asked to complete a programming exercise, called a Code Kata as part of
        the application process. We feel it is paramount that candidates spend
        a lot of time on code with plenty of opportunities for feedback. Many
        companies define TDD differently, so before you begin our Code Kata
        Exercise, please take a moment to review a video made by our own
        Craftsmen which depicts just how we approach development. If this is
        your first attempt at Test Driving and Clean Code, or if you feel
        you're not familiar with the concepts, this video will be even more
        helpful.

        We will take this code as an example of your best work.<br><br>
        We practice Test-Driven Development at Pillar, and we expect you to
        test-drive your solution to this problem. Exercises without tests or
        with only minimal coverage will not be considered.<br><br>
        We will
        evaluate both your production code and test code on the basis of:
        <ul class="outer-ul">
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Ease of building the project and running tests
            </li>
            <li>
              Project organization and ease of understanding
            </li>
            <li>
              Naming conventions and clarity
            </li>
            <li>
              Clean code (as defined by the book of the same name)
              at the module/class and function/method level
            </li>
            <li>
              Minimal duplication (DRY)
            </li>
            <li>
              Idiomatic use of the programming language and associated tools
            </li>
            <li>
              Originality of solution (it must not be plagiarized)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have katas available for several different areas of focus.
        Please select the one that aligns best with your skills and
        interests.
        If you donâ€™t have a specific area in mind,
        the Application Development Kata might be a good place to start.
