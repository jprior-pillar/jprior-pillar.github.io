          We'd like you to make your best attempt to learn the Test Driven
          Development practices and demonstrate them in the Code Kata Exercise.
          We offer in-depth orientations for new hires interested in working in
          Agile environments without prior experience, so please do not be
          intimidated. It's about what you can do versus what you've done.
        </p>
        <p class="h3">
          A Word Or Two on Building and Running Your Kata
        </p>
        <p>
          We want you to succeed with your Kata! We've already described what
          we're looking for in the code itself. Here's more information on
          other things we want to see when you hand it off to us.
        </p>
        <p class="h3">
          Building and Running Tests
        </p>
        <p>
          You must (yes, "must") include a README file with your submission
          that tells us exactly how to build and run your solution. The best
          option for us is to have one or two commands to accomplish that,
          depending on the tech stack and tools you've chosen. We'd like to see
          the equivalent of 'make build' or 'gradle test'.
        </p>
        <p class="h3">
          Managing Dependencies
        </p>
        <p>
          You're welcome to use whatever dependency management tool/approach
          you'd like. Just ensure that you're not expecting *us* to go out and
          download all your dependencies. You should include those in your
          solution, either as hard references to the files themselves, or via
          something like Gradle
          or NuGet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we want a simple way to build and run your solution. (See
          above.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Our main goal for Katas is to be able to see how you problem-solve,
          as well as your ability to generate meaningful, clean, and
          test-driven code. Our developers regularly do Katas to hone their
          skills and create more concise and simple solutions. Please use a
          Github or Bitbucket repository with frequent commits so that we may
          see into your unique brand of problem-solving. We consider this a
          representation of your best work that we will review and use to move
          your application process forward. Our goal is to have an in-depth
          conversation with you about your work. When completed, please email
          the URL to your Github or Bitbucket repository to your Talent
          Engagement contact.
